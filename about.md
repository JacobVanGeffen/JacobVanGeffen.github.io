I like talking about the games I play and how it relates to my life, so this blog is an outlet for me to do so. If you like/dislike/abhor any of my posts, I'd love to hear about it through email (see below). Hope you enjoy!

### More Info about me

Just finished by B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Texas in Austin. In the fall, I'll get started on a Ph.D. in Programming Languages at the University of Washington in Seattle. Besides gaming, I really enjoy ultimate, volleyball, and watchine anime. <!-- TODO include research/technical stuff? Or save for actual website? -->
